This script confirms two graphs are isomorphic.  Its intention is to save on noisy git commits from test re-runs; the noise comes from rdflib's json-ld module not having an obvious way to force blank nodes to be inlined.

Sample code c/o:
https://rdflib.readthedocs.io/en/4.0/_modules/rdflib/compare.html

As with the command line utility 'diff', this exits with status 0 if the files are the "same", 1 if they differ.

This script works in the same spirit as the rdflib-provided command rdfgraphisomorphism.  However, at the time of this writing, that script failed to process unit test data documented elsewhere in rdflib, and also lacked flexibility in specifying graph formats other than a hard-coded closed set.  That list did not include JSON-LD, which is the format the CASE community uses for its instance data.

The failure to run was reported on 2018-02-22:
https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/812

On resolution of rdflib issue 812, and on adding some format-support flexibility, isomorphic_diff.py is likely to be deprecated in favor of using the upstream rdfgraphisomorphism command.
