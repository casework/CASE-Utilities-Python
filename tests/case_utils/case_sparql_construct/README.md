# Test of CASE SPARQL CONSTRUCT query runner


## Test procedure

The tests in this directory confirms `case_sparql_construct` satisfies a base set of expected command line functionality.
1. Inputs - `input-2.ttl` and `input-3.json` contain a small graph split across two files, and `input-1.sparql` contains a SPARQL `CONSTRUCT` query.
2. Outputs - `output.ttl` is generated by using `case_sparql_construct` to run `input-1.sparql` against the two `input-*.*` graph files.  This affirms that `case_sparql_construct` can read multiple input files of differing formats.
3. Output verification - two name-pairs should have vcard records generated.  The test `test_templates_with_blank_nodes_result()` confirms those pairs are in the output graph.


## References

The data and query used in `input-2.ttl`, `input-3.json` and `input.sparql` are copied from ["SPARQL Query Language for RDF", Section 10.2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/#tempatesWithBNodes), with these modifications:
* `input-2.ttl` contains the original example's `_:a` (Alice) records, but drops the `_:b` (Bob) records.
* `input-3.json` is a conversion of the original Turtle example's `_:b` records to JSON-LD.
