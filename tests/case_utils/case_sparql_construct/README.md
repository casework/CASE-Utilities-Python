# Test of CASE SPARQL CONSTRUCT query runner

The tests in this directory confirms `case_sparql_construct` satisfies a base set of expected command line functionality.


## Test procedure

1. Inputs - `w3-input-2.ttl` and `w3-input-3.json` contain a small graph split across two files, and `w3-input-1.sparql` contains a SPARQL `CONSTRUCT` query.
2. Outputs - `w3-output.ttl` is generated by using `case_sparql_construct` to run `w3-input-1.sparql` against the two `w3-input-*.*` graph files.  This affirms that `case_sparql_construct` can read multiple input files of differing formats.
3. Output verification - two name-pairs should have vcard records generated.  The tests `test_w3_templates_with_blank_nodes_result_json()` and `_turtle()` confirm those pairs are in the output graphs.


## References

The data and query used in `w3-input-2.ttl`, `w3-input-3.json` and `w3-input.sparql` are copied from ["SPARQL Query Language for RDF", Section 10.2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/#tempatesWithBNodes), with these modifications:
* `w3-input-2.ttl` contains the original example's `_:a` (Alice) records, but drops the `_:b` (Bob) records.
* `w3-input-3.json` is a conversion of the original Turtle example's `_:b` records to JSON-LD.
